        I'm a Programming Technician student with a strong passion for
        technology and web development. I dedicate every day to programming,
        learning, and improving my skills, with the clear goal of becoming a
        highly competent professional. I specialize in front-end development
        with React, Bootstrap, and CSS, and have back-end knowledge using
        Node.js, Express, and MySQL. I'm focused on building functional,
        accessible, and visually appealing solutions. I consider myself a
        self-taught, curious, and committed person, with a good level of
        English.
